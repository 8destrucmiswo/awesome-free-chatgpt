Orifice plates are one of the most common and simple devices for measuring fluid flow. They consist of a thin plate with a circular hole or aperture that is inserted in the conduit. The fluid passing through the orifice plate creates a pressure difference between the upstream and downstream sides of the plate, which can be measured by pressure tappings. The flow rate can then be calculated from the pressure difference and the known geometry of the orifice plate.
 
However, to obtain accurate and reliable measurements, it is important to follow certain guidelines for the design, installation and operation of orifice plates. Iso 5167 2 Orifice Plates Pdf Free provides detailed information on these aspects, such as:
 
- The description and dimensions of different types of orifice plates, such as concentric, eccentric, segmental and quadrant-edge.
- The location and dimensions of different types of pressure tappings, such as flange, corner, D and D/2.
- The coefficients and corresponding uncertainties of orifice plates for different Reynolds numbers and diameter ratios.
- The pressure loss caused by the orifice plate and how to estimate it.
- The minimum upstream and downstream straight lengths required for installation between various fittings and the orifice plate.
- The use of flow conditioners to improve the flow profile and reduce the effects of disturbances.
- The circularity and cylindricality of the pipe and how to check them.
- The location of orifice plate and carrier rings and how to fix them securely.
- The method of fixing and gaskets to prevent leakage.
