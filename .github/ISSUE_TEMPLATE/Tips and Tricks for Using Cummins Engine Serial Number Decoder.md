# How to Decode Cummins Engine Serial Numbers
  
If you own a Cummins engine, you may need to decode its serial number for various purposes, such as ordering parts, servicing, or registering your warranty. But where can you find the serial number and what does it mean? In this article, we will explain how to locate and interpret Cummins engine serial numbers.
  
## Where to Find Cummins Engine Serial Numbers
  
Cummins engine serial numbers (ESN) are eight or nine digits long and consist of numbers and letters. They are unique for each engine and can be used to identify the model, year, horsepower, and other specifications of your Cummins engine.

The ESN is usually located on a metal tag called a dataplate that is attached to the engine block or the front cover/gear housing. The dataplate contains other information as well, such as the critical parts list (CPL), the emission statement, and the engine rating.

Cummins ESNs have different formats depending on the year and model of the engine. Here are some examples of how to decode Cummins ESNs:
  
- ESN: 79012136
    - This is an example of an older ESN format that has eight digits and starts with a 7.
    - The first digit (7) indicates the engine model. In this case, it is a 6BT 5.9L engine.
    - The second digit (9) indicates the year of manufacture. In this case, it is 1989.
    - The third and fourth digits (01) indicate the month of manufacture. In this case, it is January.
    - The last four digits (2136) are the sequence number of the engine within that month.
- ESN: 46656398
    - This is another example of an older ESN format that has eight digits and does not start with a 7.
    - The first two digits (46) indicate the CPL. In this case, it is CPL 1211.
    - The third digit (6) indicates the year of manufacture. In this case, it is 1996.
    - The fourth digit (5) indicates the month of manufacture. In this case, it is May.
    - The last four digits (6398) are the sequence number of the engine within that month.
- ESN: 79327373
    - This is an example of a newer ESN format that has eight digits and starts with a 7.
    - The first digit (7) indicates the engine model. In this case, it is a QSK60 engine.
    - The second digit (9) indicates the year of manufacture. In this case, it is 2009.
    - The third and fourth digits (32) indicate the plant where the engine was built. In this case, it is Jamestown Engine Plant in New York.
    - The last four digits (7373) are the sequence number of the engine within that plant.
- ESN: D103012BX03
