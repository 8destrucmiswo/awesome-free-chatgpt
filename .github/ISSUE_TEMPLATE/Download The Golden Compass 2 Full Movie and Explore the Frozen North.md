The Golden Compass 2 is a sequel to the 2007 fantasy film The Golden Compass, based on the first book of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy. The film follows the adventures of Lyra Belacqua, a young girl who travels to different worlds with her daemon Pantalaimon and a golden compass that can reveal the truth. Along the way, she meets new allies and enemies, such as Lord Asriel, Marisa Coulter, Iorek Byrnison, and the Magisterium.
 
Unfortunately, The Golden Compass 2 was never made due to the poor box office performance and mixed reviews of the first film. However, fans of the books can still enjoy the story through other media, such as the BBC/HBO television series His Dark Materials, which premiered in 2019 and has been renewed for a third and final season. The series stars Dafne Keen as Lyra, James McAvoy as Lord Asriel, Ruth Wilson as Marisa Coulter, and Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee Scoresby.
