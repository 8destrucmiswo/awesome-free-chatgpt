FMRTE is a real time editor and scout tool for Football Manager 2010 that allows you to edit various aspects of the game, such as player attributes, club information, finances, transfers and more. FMRTE is compatible with different versions of FM 2010, including the demo, the DVD, the Steam and the digital download versions. In this article, we will show you how to download, install and use FMRTE for FM 2010.
 
## Downloading and installing FMRTE

FMRTE comes in two editions: installer and compressed. The installer version is recommended because it will detect if you need the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (and redirect you to the framework download page). The compressed version is a zip file that contains the FMRTE executable and some other files. You need to extract the zip file to a folder of your choice and run FMRTE.exe.
 
Before running FMRTE, you need to make sure that FM 2010 is running and you have loaded a savegame. Then, you can launch FMRTE and click on the load game button. FMRTE will scan your savegame and load the data into its interface.
 
## Using FMRTE
 
FMRTE has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to browse and edit different aspects of the game. You can use the tabs on the left side to switch between different sections, such as players, staff, clubs, nations, stadiums, etc. You can also use the search function to find specific items by name or ID.
 
To edit an item, you need to select it from the list and click on the edit button on the right side. A new window will pop up with various fields that you can modify. For example, if you want to edit a player's attributes, you can change their values in the player attributes section. You can also edit their personal information, contract details, positions, preferred moves, relations and more.
 
After making your changes, you need to click on the save button to apply them to your savegame. You can also use the freeze button to prevent an item from changing in the game. For example, if you want to keep a player's attributes constant, you can freeze them using FMRTE.
 
FMRTE also has some advanced features that allow you to do more than just editing. For example, you can use the mass edit function to apply changes to multiple items at once. You can also use the swap function to exchange two items in the game. For example, if you want to swap two players between clubs, you can do so using FMRTE.
