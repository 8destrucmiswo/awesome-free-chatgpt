# How to Install Twido Modbus Driver for Windows 10
 
If you are using a Twido programmable logic controller (PLC) and want to communicate with it using the Modbus protocol, you will need to install a Modbus driver for your Windows 10 computer. The Modbus driver will allow you to use various Schneider programs, such as TwidoSuite, Advantys, and PL7, to configure and monitor your Twido PLC.
 
However, Twido is an obsolete product and has been replaced by the M221 PLC and the EcoStruxure Machine Expert Basic software (formerly TwidoSuite). The latest version of TwidoSuite, version 2.31.4, only supports Windows 7 64 bit. Therefore, if you want to use TwidoSuite on Windows 10, you will need to run it in compatibility mode or use a virtual machine.

Alternatively, you can migrate your Twido program to the M221 PLC and use the EcoStruxure Machine Expert Basic software, which is compatible with Windows 10. You can import your old Twido program into Machine Expert Basic and load it into the M221 PLC. This way, you can benefit from the enhanced features and performance of the new PLC and software.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install the Modbus driver for Windows 10 that supports both the TSXCUSB485 USB cable and the TSXPCX1031 serial cable. These cables are used to connect your computer to your Twido PLC. We will also show you how to run TwidoSuite in compatibility mode on Windows 10.
