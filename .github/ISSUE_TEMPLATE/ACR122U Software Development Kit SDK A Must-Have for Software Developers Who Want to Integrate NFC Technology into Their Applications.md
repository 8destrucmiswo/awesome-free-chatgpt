# How to Download and Use the ACR122U Software Development Kit SDK
 
The ACR122U is a USB NFC reader that supports contactless smart cards and tags based on ISO 14443 and ISO 18092 standards. It can be used for various applications such as e-payment, access control, personal identity verification, mass transit and toll road fare collection. To develop your own applications using the ACR122U, you will need the ACR122U Software Development Kit SDK.
 
The ACR122U SDK provides a comprehensive collection of sample codes for device and contactless card programming using different programming languages such as Java, Delphi, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Visual C#, and Visual Basic .Net. It also includes a Smart Poster application that demonstrates the peer-to-peer capability of the ACR122U. The SDK contains the following components:

To download the ACR122U SDK, you can visit the official website of ACS (Advanced Card Systems), the manufacturer of the ACR122U reader. The website is [https://www.acs.com.hk/en/product-lines/10/software-development-kits/](https://www.acs.com.hk/en/product-lines/10/software-development-kits/). On this page, you can find various software development kits for different ACS smart card readers. Scroll down to find the ACR122U SDK and click on the "Download" button. You will be redirected to a page where you can choose your operating system and download the appropriate driver installer. After downloading the driver installer, run it and follow the instructions to install the driver for your ACR122U reader.
 
Once you have installed the driver, you can insert the CD-ROM that comes with the SDK into your computer and explore its contents. You will find folders with different programming languages and sample codes. You can open any of them and run the executable files to test the functionality of the ACR122U reader and the contactless cards. You can also modify the source codes or create your own applications using your preferred programming language and IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

To use the Smart Poster application, you will need two ACR122U readers connected to two different computers. One reader will act as the smart poster and display a message or a URL on its LED. The other reader will act as the NFC device and read the message or open the URL on its browser. To run this application, you will need to install Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on both computers. Then, open the folder "Java\SmartPoster" on both computers and run "SmartPoster.exe" on one computer and "NFCDevice.exe" on another computer. Follow the instructions on each application to set up the communication between the two readers.
 
The ACR122U SDK is a useful tool for developers who want to create their own applications using the ACR122U NFC reader. It provides sample codes, tools, utilities, demos and reference materials that can help you get started with NFC technology. You can download it for free from the ACS website and start developing your own NFC solutions.
