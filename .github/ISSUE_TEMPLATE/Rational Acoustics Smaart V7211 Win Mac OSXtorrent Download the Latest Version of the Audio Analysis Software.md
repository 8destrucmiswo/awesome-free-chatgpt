- Real-Time Mode: A multi-engine FFT-based measurement mode that provides real-time analysis of spectrum, transfer function and impulse response data. Real-Time Mode allows users to monitor and adjust the frequency response, phase alignment, coherence and delay of sound systems, as well as identify and correct acoustic problems such as feedback, comb filtering and room modes.
- Impulse Response Mode: A measurement mode that captures and analyzes the impulse response of a sound system or an acoustic space. Impulse Response Mode allows users to measure parameters such as reverberation time, early decay time, clarity, definition and speech intelligibility, as well as perform convolution-based processing such as equalization, filtering and deconvolution.
- SPL Mode: A measurement mode that provides multi-channel, remotely monitorable SPL metering and logging features. SPL Mode allows users to measure and record sound pressure levels in various formats such as A-weighted, C-weighted, Z-weighted, Leq, Lmax, Lmin and Lpeak, as well as comply with noise regulations and standards.

Smaart V7211 also supports a wide range of hardware devices such as audio interfaces, microphones, calibrators, mixers and controllers. Smaart V7211 can interface with other software applications such as REW room analysis software, Dante audio networking software and Lake Controller software. Smaart V7211 can also be integrated with third-party plugins and modules that extend its functionality and compatibility.
 
Smaart V7211 is available in four different editions: Smaart Suite, Smaart RT, Smaart LE and Smaart SPL. Each edition has a different feature set and price point to suit different user needs and budgets. Smaart V7211 can be purchased as either a perpetual license or an annual subscription license from Rational Acoustics' online store[^5^].
 
Smaart V7211 is a powerful tool for acoustic test and measurement that can help sound engineers and audio professionals achieve better sound quality, performance and efficiency in their work.
