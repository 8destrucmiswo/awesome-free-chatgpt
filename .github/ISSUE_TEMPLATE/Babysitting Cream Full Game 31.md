Babysitting Cream is a video game that was first released in Flash format on February 5, 2013. The current and final version of the game is v1.01. Due to some technical issues with Flash, the developers decided to remake the game using GameMaker, a software that allows creating games without coding. This would make the game easier to update and fix in the future.[2][3][4]
