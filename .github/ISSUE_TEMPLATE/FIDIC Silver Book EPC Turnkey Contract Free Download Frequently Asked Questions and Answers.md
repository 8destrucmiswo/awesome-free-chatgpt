- You can download a PDF version of the original 1999 edition of the FIDIC Silver Book EPC Turnkey Contract from some online sources[^3^]. However, this edition is outdated and does not reflect the latest updates and amendments made by FIDIC in 2017 and 2022. Moreover, this edition may not be legally valid or enforceable in some jurisdictions.
- You can download a PDF version of the amendments made by FIDIC in 2017 and 2022 to the FIDIC Silver Book EPC Turnkey Contract from the FIDIC website[^1^] [^2^]. However, these amendments are not standalone documents and they have to be read together with the original 1999 edition of the FIDIC Silver Book EPC Turnkey Contract. Moreover, these amendments may not cover all the aspects and issues that may arise in your specific project.
- You can try to find a copy of the FIDIC Silver Book EPC Turnkey Contract from a library or a colleague who has purchased it. However, this may not be easy or convenient as the FIDIC Silver Book EPC Turnkey Contract is not a common or popular document. Moreover, you may not be able to make copies or modifications to the document without violating the intellectual property rights of FIDIC.

As you can see, downloading the FIDIC Silver Book EPC Turnkey Contract for free is not a simple or advisable option. You may end up with an incomplete, outdated or invalid document that may not suit your project needs or protect your interests.
