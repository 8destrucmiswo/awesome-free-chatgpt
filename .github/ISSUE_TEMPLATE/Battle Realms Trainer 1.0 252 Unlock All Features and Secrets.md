## What is Battle Realms?
 
Battle Realms is a real-time strategy game that was released in 2001 by Liquid Entertainment and Crave Entertainment. The game is set in a fantasy world inspired by Asian mythology and martial arts. The game features four playable clans: the Dragon, the Wolf, the Serpent, and the Lotus. Each clan has its own unique units, buildings, and abilities that reflect their culture and philosophy.
 
The game's story mode follows the journey of Kenji, the exiled heir of the Dragon clan, who returns to his homeland after seven years. He can choose to either restore the honor of his clan or join the Serpent clan and seek revenge. Along the way, he will encounter allies and enemies from the other clans and face a dark threat that threatens to destroy the world.
 
The game's gameplay is based on resource management, unit training, and combat. The game uses two resources: rice and water. Rice is harvested from fields and water is collected from wells. Units are trained in buildings that require both resources and a peasant. Units can also be upgraded by training them in different buildings or by using special items. Combat is fast-paced and tactical, with units having different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. The game also features a morale system that affects the performance of units in battle.
