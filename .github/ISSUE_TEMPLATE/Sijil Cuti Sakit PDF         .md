According to the Malaysian law, Sijil Cuti Sakit can only be issued to those who are personally sick or injured and unable to work or study.

- Compassionate leave: This is a type of leave that can be granted by the employer or the school for compassionate reasons, such as a child's terminal illness or death. The duration and conditions of compassionate leave may vary depending on the employer's or school's policy.
- Annual leave: This is a type of leave that can be used by the employee for any personal reason, such as a child's minor illness or vaccination. The duration and conditions of annual leave may vary depending on the employer's policy.
- Unpaid leave: This is a type of leave that can be requested by the employee if they have exhausted their paid leave entitlements, such as emergency leave, compassionate leave, or annual leave. The duration and conditions of unpaid leave may vary depending on the employer's policy.

Parents who need to take leave from work or school to take care of their sick children should inform their employer or school as soon as possible and provide relevant documents, such as a doctor's letter or a hospital admission slip. Parents should also arrange for alternative care for their children if they cannot take leave or if their leave is insufficient.
